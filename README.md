Restaurant Revenue Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses historical restaurant data and machine learning models to predict monthly revenue based on key business factors such as customer numbers, menu pricing, marketing spend, and more. The goal is to help restaurant owners and investors make data-driven financial decisions.

Project Overview

Objective: Predict a restaurant’s revenue using historical and business data.
Dataset: Contains features such as Number of Customers, Menu Price, Marketing Spend, Cuisine Type, Promotions, Reviews, and Average Customer Spending.
Best Model: Linear Regression with an R² score of 0.674.
Other Models: Random Forest, XGBoost (with GridSearchCV tuning).

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Features:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trains and evaluates different models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters using GridSearchCV.

Performance Metrics: R² score to evaluate model performance.


Summary
This project focuses on predicting a restaurant's monthly revenue based on historical data and key business factors. By utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the project demonstrates how different models can be tuned and evaluated for improved predictions. The top-performing model, Linear Regression, achieved an R² score of 0.674. With thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, the goal is to help restaurant owners and decision-makers make data-driven financial decisions.
